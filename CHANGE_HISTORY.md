# Change History

## 2026-07-12 22:10 — Administration section, Module Settings, and visual polish

- Added a full Administration section: tree nav with a distinct SVG icon per
  node, a collapsible tree panel (flattens to icon-only when collapsed),
  Module/Application Configuration, 10 color themes, About, and a Change
  History page that renders this file.
- Added the Module Settings feature: a new `module_settings` table (per-module
  key/value store), a `src/lib/module-settings` domain module, and a
  `CollapsibleCard`-based editor per module, wired into the existing Save
  Settings / Reset to Default flow.
- Fixed a data-integrity bug: `resetToDefaults` on `modules` now upserts by
  slug instead of delete-then-insert, so a module's id (and its settings)
  survives "Reset to Default" instead of being silently orphaned.
- Added a second module, Stock & ETFs, and a combined home/AI-magic/finance
  themed SVG app icon (favicon + in-app branding, next to the wordmark).
- Sidebar/home screen visual pass: restyled the sidebar from dark to light per
  feedback, added Home and Administration as their own nav rows (own icons,
  out of the cramped header), centered the home screen header row, and gave
  the Administration button and module cards deeper, more separated 3D drop
  shadows.
- Rewrote the `build_project` skill into a full release checkpoint (log →
  verify → sync docs → commit).
- Initialized git and linked the GitHub remote
  (`https://github.com/rvpals/MyHomeBase.git`).
